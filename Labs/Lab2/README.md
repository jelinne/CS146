First checked to see if strings s and t were the same length. If they 
weren't, I would return false. I would also return false if they were 
the same word because that would not be considered an anagram. Sorted 
s and t, and checked to see if they equaled one another. If they did, 
that means they have the exact same letters, so they would be 
considered an anagram.
